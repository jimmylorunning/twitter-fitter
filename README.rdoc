== Twitter, Fitter

I made this app as a way of learning about Rails, the Twitter API, and markov chains. But it turned out pretty awesome: Twitter Fitter is an app where you can join any two Twitter accounts to create new and interesting franken-tweets. You can see it in action on to {Heroku}[https://secret-brushlands-4139.herokuapp.com/]. You can also read about what I've learned on {my blog}[http://jimmylocoding.com].
